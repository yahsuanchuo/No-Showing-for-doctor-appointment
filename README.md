# No Showing for doctor appointment
#### This project using R as the whole analysis. It include `data cleaning`, `data exploration`, and `data visualization` by using ggplot2 and ggivs.
#### I am looking for the reasons or some facts that shows what certain patterns people not showing after they register the doctor appointment. This data collected the patients with their age, gender, the disease they have, the appointments happened year,month, week of day and the appointments day they made. Also, they waiting time between these day and the status shows that they do show up or not.

#### Data Source: The data is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments which is a dataset that uploaded two months ago. A new dataset made me more space to analyze it.
